# About The Project
When I researched about bank management on Github I didn't see a good enough source code and I made this project just to see how well I could do it. The project generally uses 'stdlib.h', 'stdio.h' and 'string.h' libraries in the c language, and the system structure is entirely using file layout. Written to be used with servers. Please indicate in the "issues" section if you encounter any errors or problems.
